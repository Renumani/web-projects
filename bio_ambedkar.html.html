Ambedkar continuously fought for the eradication of caste discrimination that had spread like a disease in Indian society. As he was born in a socially backward family, Ambedkar was a Dalit who was a victim of caste discrimination and inequality. However, against all odds, Ambedkar became the first Dalit to complete higher education. He then went on and completed college and got a doctorate in economics from London University.</p>
<p>He entered politics entirely aiming to fight for the rights of the backward classes and against the inequality practiced in the society. After India became independent he went on to become the first law minister of free India and the chief architect of the ‘Constitution of India’.Later in 1956, he converted to Buddhism, as he considered it to be ‘the most scientific religion’.
