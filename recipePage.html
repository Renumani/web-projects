            <h2>Preparation</h2>
			<h3><b>Frying dry fruits</b></h3>
            <p>In a heavy kadai or a thick bottomed pan take 6 tablespoons ghee. Heat ghee on a medium-low flame till it melts completely.Add 3 to 4 tablespoons cashews.
            Begin to fry cashews stirring them often.
			Fry cashews till golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep aside on kitchen paper towels or in a plate.Next add 1 tablespoon raisins in the hot ghee and Stir non-stop to fry the raisins.
			The raisins will become plump and swell.As soon as the raisins become plump, remove them and keep aside along with the fried cashews.</p>
			<br>
			<h3><b>Roasting Rava</b></h3>
			<p>Now reduce flame to a low and add 1 cup fine rava (160 grams) to the ghee.Combine and mix the rava with the ghee.Begin to roast rava on a low to medium-low flame. 
			Stir often so that rava roasts evenly.The color of the rava should not become brown. Roasting rava takes approx 9 to 11 minutes on a low to medium-low flame. 
			Roast till you can see the ghee getting separated and the color of rava will also change. A nice aroma will also emanate from the roasted rava.</p>
			<br>
			<h3><b>Making Sugar Syrup</b></h3>	
			<p>When you begin to roast rava, at that time take ¾ cup sugar (190 to 200 grams) in a sauce pan.The sugar syrup needs to be cooked simultaneously while roasting rava.
			Add 2 to 3 pinches of saffron strands.Add 2.5 cups of water. Optionally you can also add a natural yellow or orange color extract.
			Keep the pan on stovetop and on a medium to medium-high flame begin to heat the sugar solution.</p>
			<p>Bring this sugar solution to a rolling boil.In case the sugar solution has come to a boil, but rava has not yet roasted, then reduce the flame to a low and simmer 
		    the sugar solution for a couple of minutes – so that it stays hot.By the time the sugar solution starts boiling, the rava will also get roasted well.
			Lower the flame and now carefully pour the sugar-saffron solution in the hot ghee-rava mixture in a steady stream and slowly</p>
			<br>
			<h3><b>Making Rava Kesari</b></h3>	
			<p>Take care while pouring as the mixture splutters. In this kesari recipe, lumps are not formed as the quantity of water is more.In case if lumps do form then just break them with the spatula or spoon.
			Stir and mix very well. Break lumps, if any while mixing.Cook the mixture on a low to medium-low flame stirring often.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The rava will absorb the water and swell and the mixture will begin to thicken.It will be soft and moist and the consistency will be like that of smooth pudding.
			When the mixture starts thickening, add the fried cashews and raisins reserving a few for the garnish.</P>
